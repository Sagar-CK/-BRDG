## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- [Convex CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/cli/install) (`npm install -g convex`)

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Sagar-CK/bet-on-the-bridge.git
   cd bet-on-the-bridge
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up Convex:**
   - Create a [Convex project](https://dashboard.convex.dev/).
   - Copy your deployment URL and set it in a `.env.local` file:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL="https://<your-convex-deployment>.convex.cloud"
     ```
   - Push schema and functions:
     ```bash
     convex dev
     ```
4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start both the frontend (Next.js) and backend (Convex) in parallel.
